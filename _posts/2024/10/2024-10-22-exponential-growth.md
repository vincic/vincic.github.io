A few years ago, I faced a recurring challenge: my ambitions were always high, but my lack of commitment kept holding me back. This is a story about how I learned to overcome that, step by step, in two key areas of my life—health and work. 

It all started when I joined [Eletive](https://eletive.com), where I picked up some valuable lessons on [self-leadership](https://sasha.vincic.org/blog/2024/06/fun-and-self-leadership). These lessons made me realize I had been neglecting my health for far too long. Around two years ago, I made a decision: I would change my habits, starting with small, consistent actions.

## From Small Steps to Big Results

I began with modest goals—running a few kilometers here and there and hitting the gym when I could. I failed, restarted, and failed again. But I never gave up. Today, I'm in a groove. I run nearly every day, covering at least 5km per run, and I fit in a few gym sessions each week. These simple habits transformed into something much bigger.

Now, my daily 5km runs add up to about few marathons each month. It's proof that small, consistent steps can lead to substantial growth. Not only is my fitness improving, but I'm more productive at work and in life. The key is consistency—progress may be slow, but as long as I keep moving, I'm heading in the right direction.

## Leveraging AI: A Slow and Steady Journey

The same principle of small steps applies to my work with AI. My goal is to automate around 80% of my tasks with AI, freeing up more time for creativity and innovation. But just like with my health journey, it's a slow process.

New language models appear almost daily, tempting me to test each one and distract me from my broader goal. Recently, I explored frameworks like CrewAi, only to find that many AI tools promise the moon but fail to deliver for their cost. When deadlines are tight, I might consider paying for convenience, but learning the technology is more valuable in the long run.

I’ve settled on a straightforward strategy: If you have some coding skills and a bit of time, you don’t need fancy frameworks. Most LLM tools support OpenAI’s API format, making them interchangeable. I start by working with OpenAI (and sometimes Claude.ai) to get a solution running, and then adapt it to Ollama. With GPU limitations becoming a challenge, I'm now exploring serverless options for hosting LLMs.

## Consistency Over Time

Both my health and AI journeys share a common red line: **consistency over time leads to exponential growth**. Small, steady steps can add up to monumental changes, whether you're improving your fitness or automating your workflow. 

So, what’s your next step? Keep moving forward, and let's meet at the finish line!
