Recently, I've been feeling overwhelmed, with my mind stuck in a loop of worries. It has affected my sleep, productivity, and motivation. Andrew Huberman reminds us:
> *"Our brains are plastic, and we have the ability to change and shape them throughout our entire lives."*

Breaking free from a negative cycle is challenging, but it's crucial not to let it spin too long or too fast. Training the mind and getting good sleep are essential, but when sleepless nights become frequent due to racing thoughts, it's time to take action and reclaim your peace of mind.

> Stay mindful, stay rested, and remember: it's never too late to reshape your thoughts and habits.
