Next week, I'm excited to attend the [Git Merge conference](https://git-merge.com/) in Berlin. The main reason for my enthusiasm is getting to meet Scott Chacon, aka Git Butler, whose YouTube talks have been incredibly insightful and inspiring. After many years in this profession, I still believe that there's always something new to learn, and meeting people who excel at what they do is a fantastic way to pick their brains and gain valuable knowledge.

What's more, I'm looking forward to learning from the amazing lineup of speakers at Git Merge 2024. With talks like "Abusing Git for GitButler" by Scott Chacon, "Scaling Git" by Taylor Blau, and "Securing Repositories with Gittuf" by Aditya Sirish A Yelgundhalli, I know I'll be in for a treat.

As someone who enjoys teaching and sharing knowledge when meeting people eager to learn, I'm also excited about the prospect of connecting with like-minded individuals at the conference. Git Merge promises to be an incredible opportunity for growth, learning, and networking.

For those interested, here's a sneak peek at the impressive speaker lineup:

* Scott Chacon (GitButler): Abusing Git for GitButler
* Emily Shaffer (Google): State of Libification: Overview and Update
* Daniele Sassoli (GerritForge): Leveraging AI for Git Monorepo Performance
* Taylor Blau (GitHub): Scaling Git
* Aditya Sirish A Yelgundhalli: Securing Repositories with Gittuf
* Sebastian Thiel: Gitoxide: What it is, and isn't
* Patrick Steinhardt (GitLab): Reftable Backend Introduction
* Elijah Newren (GitHub): Git History Rewriting with git-filter-repo
* Martin von Zweigbergk (Google): Jujutsu: Git-Compatible VCS
* Brian Carlson: Git Credential Helper Protocol Updates
* Edward Thomson (Stacklok): libgit2: Past, Present, Future

If you're attending the conference, I'd love to connect and chat about all things Git. Let's make it a fantastic learning experience!
