title: The challenge of letting go in coding and life

Letting go is hard. Whether it's about not being there for everyone all the time or relinquishing control over how things should be done, it's a challenge many of us face. But letting go is also necessary for others to grow, and for us to avoid becoming indispensable in ways that hinder progress.

In the world of coding, this struggle is all too familiar. For instance, letting the team install Prettier to format the code instead of sticking rigidly to my personal style has been tough. Delivering code that works but looks ugly, at least to my eyes, feels almost painful. I often ask myself: what's more important—shipping something functional and on time, or perfecting the aesthetics at the cost of delay?

I wrestle with this daily. It feels amazing to deliver something and not care as much about how it looks, but part of me also feels like I'm giving up. Yet, this is the essence of growth—learning to prioritize what truly matters in the bigger picture, even if it means letting go of some control.

Letting go doesn't mean losing; it means choosing the battles that matter most. Each day, I'm learning to embrace this balance, and with each release, I'm finding a new sense of accomplishment.
