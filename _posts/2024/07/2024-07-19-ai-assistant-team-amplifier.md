Remember when productivity tools only helped individuals? AI assistants are rewriting that story. Custom ChatGPTs now uplift entire teams. In minutes, not months. It's not just about personal efficiency. It's about collective empowerment.

Take our "Enzyme Exterminator." A custom AI I built that converts old Jest Enzyme tests to Jest Testing Library/React. In TypeScript. With our style and render helpers. But here's the kicker: I shared it with the team. Suddenly, one person's solution became everyone's superpower. A rising tide that lifts all boats.  It's not just a tool. It's a catalyst. A force multiplier for team productivity.

The AI gets us 80%, even 90% of the way there. The team's collective expertise handles the rest, adding context, nuance, and that human touch that turns good into great. This isn't about replacing team members. It's about amplifying them. Freeing us all to focus on the high-value work that humans do best. 

What could your team achieve with an AI assistant that gets you 90% of the way there? What bottlenecks could you eliminate? What innovations could you unlock?

The future of work isn't about lone geniuses. It's about empowered teams, armed with AI co-pilots, achieving the extraordinary together.

Are you ready to amplify not just yourself, but your entire team? What's stopping you from creating your team's next game-changing AI assistant?
