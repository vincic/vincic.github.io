## Digital Viking and tech lead

As a seasoned software engineer with over 25 years of experience, my journey in the tech industry has been both expansive and deeply fulfilling. Graduating with a Bachelor of Computer Science from Linköpings University, I took my first entrepreneurial steps by founding a company with friends. Our flagship product was a pioneering CMS built in Perl, a project that set the stage for my career in crafting robust digital solutions.

Over the years, I’ve worn many hats – from a small business owner to leading development teams and mentoring the next generation of tech innovators. My early days involved creating websites, intranets, and ecommerce solutions, all grounded in our Perl-based CMS and later in **Plone**, renowned for its security and efficiency. The thrill of these ventures led me to expand my horizons, outsourcing development to Poland and diving into the ecommerce niche.

A highlight of my career was my tenure at Game Analytics. It was here that I immersed myself in a vibrant startup culture, indulging in Python and JavaScript coding, web and cloud technologies, all while surrounded by a dynamic team  – and yes, there was always beer in the fridge!

Today, as a Tech Lead and AI Engineer at [Eletive](https://www.linkedin.com/company/eletive/), I channel my expertise into building sophisticated survey solutions that drive employee engagement. My colleagues often commend me as an "outstanding developer with a fantastic attitude" and value my extensive knowledge base. My work is more than just a series of tasks; it’s a mission to transform workplaces through AI-driven insights, enhancing the employee experience and making a tangible difference in the world of work.

In every role and project, I embrace my identity as a 'Digital Viking' – a relentless explorer of the digital realm, always seeking new knowledge and challenges. Whether I’m coding, building developer teams, or mentoring, my passion lies in empowering others and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with technology. This journey of exploration and impact is what fuels my Viking spirit in the digital age.
