Ever notice how your to-do list grows faster than [kudzu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kudzu) in summer? We chase the horizon of 'done', only to find it's an illusion. Time, that slippery fish, always seems to wriggle out of our grasp. But what if we're asking the wrong question? Instead of "How can I get everything done?", try "What deserves my limited time?" It's not about cramming more into each minute. It's about choosing what to leave out.

*Remember*: the inbox will always refill, there's always one more task lurking, and 'caught up' is a temporary state. We often measure our worth by our output, our busyness. But what if our value lies in our choices, not our checkmarks? Next time you feel the pressure of the undone, pause. Look at your list not as a burden, but as a buffet. You can't eat everything, so choose wisely.

The race against time isn't one we can win. But maybe winning isn't the point. Perhaps true mastery isn't about conquering time, but about making peace with its limits. 

Are you chasing completion, or embracing the journey? 

Are you managing your tasks, or are your tasks managing you?
