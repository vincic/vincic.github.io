Two more sunsets. 48 hours until liberation.

Then, this Digital Viking trades his battle station for a mobile command center. The mission? Code with a view.

Scandinavia's summer promises 20°C breezes and moody skies. A Tesla becomes my rolling office—because why should the desk have all the fun?

Why go? Because sometimes changing your longitude changes your code. The open road offers commits no cubicle can inspire.

My mind hums with ideas, freed from the usual surroundings. Innovation isn't always about a different what, but a different where.

This isn't an escape from work. It's work, escaped.

What's on the itinerary? Debugging by the fjords. Blogging from hidden valleys. Pushing updates under the midnight sun.

The journey begins soon. The keyboard never stops.

Where's your ideal spot for a 'workcation'? How do you recharge without unplugging?
