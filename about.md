## My roots
Born and living in south of Sweden. My family is from all over the world, grandfather from Belarus, my father from Yugoslavia (it still exists in my memories), my mom from Poland and a brother. Since few years back I have a beautiful Russian wife and two sons, one stepson who is one of the smartest and a young son who is just exploring everything.

## Developer and entrepreneur
After I finished  my Bachelor of Computer Science at Link√∂pings University I founded my first company with friends. We built Internet solutions where our main product was a CMS written in Perl! It was really, really good. I later continued as a small business owner building websites, intranets and ecommerce solutions based on our own Perl based CMS and later **Plone**, the [most secure open source CMS](http://plone.org). After few years I decided I wanted to focus on building a larger company and that meant finding people who could help out. I found more Plone developers by outsourcing development to Poland and then create a product in the ecommerce niche. Just before my current position I met the team at [Game Analytics](http://www.gameanalytics.com/aboutus.html) and that led to the absolutely most interesting and fun project I have been involved in since the Plone Snowsprints! It was a startup, it was python coding, it was Javascript coding, it was web and cloud, it was fun people and there was beer in the fridge!
