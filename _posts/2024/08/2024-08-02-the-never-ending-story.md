The quest for a better life is a never-ending story. But in this journey, are you running away from something or are you chasing a goal? What is the difference, and how do you spot it?

Running away from something often stems from a desire to escape discomfort, pain, or dissatisfaction. It’s driven by a need to leave behind negative situations or emotions. When you’re running away, your focus is on what you want to avoid, and your decisions are reactive.

On the other hand, chasing a goal is proactive and purposeful. It’s about striving towards a vision or aspiration. When you’re chasing a goal, your focus is on what you want to achieve, and your actions are driven by passion and ambition.

So, how do you spot the difference? Reflect on your motivations. Are you moving because you’re afraid or dissatisfied, or are you inspired and excited about your future? Examine your mindset. Are your thoughts centered on escape, or are they filled with plans and aspirations?

Understanding whether you’re running away or chasing a goal can profoundly impact your journey towards a better life. Aim to chase goals with intention and passion, rather than merely running away from what you don’t want. This shift in perspective can lead to a more fulfilling and purpose-driven life.
