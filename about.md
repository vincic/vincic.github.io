## My roots
Born and living in south of Sweden. My family is from all over the world, grand father from Belarus, my father from Yugoslavia (it still exists in my memories), my mom from Poland and a brother. Since few years back I have a beautiful russian wife and two sons, one stepson who is one of the smartest and a young son who is just exploring everything.

## History
After I finished  my Bachelor of Computer Science at Link√∂pings University I founded my first company with friends. We build internet solutions where our main product was a CMS written in Perl! It was really, really good. I later continued as a small business owner building websites, intranets and ecommerce solutions based on our own Perl based CMS and later **Plone**, the [most secure open source CMS](http://plone.org). After few years I decided I wanted to focus on building a larger company and that ment finding people who could help out.I found more Plone developers by outsourcing developent to Poland and then create a product in the ecommerce nisch. Just before my current position I met the team at [Game Analytics](http://www.gameanalytics.com/aboutus.html) and that led to the absolutely most interesting and fun project I have been involved in since the Plone Snowsprints! It was a startup, it was python coding, it was javascript coding, it was webb and cloud, it was fun people and there was beer in the fridge!

## Current
Just as I was getting comfortable, the destiny decided it was time for me to try out my first employment and become the CEO of [**Propeople in Sweden**](http://wearepropeople.se/) in 2012 August. Here my main focus is to build the Swedish part of Propeople. Propeople is an international full service digital agency which provides services in digital strategy, digital creativity and web developent. What I have learned during my 15 years in the business is that the success of a project depends on a clear stratical goal that is meassurable and that you have good developers, not just one. The number of developers is important for time to deliver, support but also the long term of your investment. Who is going to maintain it if key developer leaves? At Propeople I know we can maintain all the projects we deliver. That is because we have over 100 developers, that know [Drupal](http://wearepropeople.se/), EPiServer, Sharepoint, Wordpress and iOS/Android. That means that I don't have to worry about one key developer to be able to deliver good projects. 

## Geek
This site is probably the project I have restarted most times, this time it is based on GitHub Pages and Jekyll. It is geeky enough and at the same time very secure. A static site I can even host my self without worring to much. Today my geeky needs are satisfied by coding some home automation and following what is happening on PyPi and GitHub.
