Building LEGO is something I really enjoy, whether it's small sets or large UCS models. The joy of creating something with my hands and then holding it when it's done is amazing. Following the instructions is also a relaxation for the mind; someone has already thought through all the problems, and you just follow the steps, marveling at the solutions, one brick at a time.

This same feeling arises when I build software. I've already thought through all the problems and solved them in my head. Then, I just write the code. In this flow state, I don't need any autocompletion because I already know what I will write. I don't need a Copilot since I have my solution in my head. The only limit is how fast my fingers can convert my thoughts into running software. There's a unique satisfaction in seeing it all work as intended.

The parallels between building LEGO and writing software are striking. Both involve careful planning, problem-solving, and the joy of creation. Whether it's a LEGO model or a piece of software, the process of building something from scratch and seeing it come to life is immensely rewarding.
