title: Impressions from the eCar Expo in Copenhagen

Yesterday, I visited the eCar Expo in Copenhagen—my first car expo in years. I’ve got some nostalgic memories of going to these shows with my father, but I made sure my expectations for this one were low. The spotlight this year was on some flashy names: the *Mercedes Vision One-Eleven* concept car and the *Tesla Cybertruck*. But as cool as those sound on paper, I was ready for anything.

I sat in as many cars as I could and opened the hoods on several, hoping for some surprises. But overall, the scene gave off a bit of a “same old, different sticker” vibe. A lot of cars featured shiny touch screens, with one opting for curved display. Ironically, one of the more high-tech cars sported a color so prone to fingerprints that touching was off-limits—like handing out candy that’s too precious to taste. Even *BMW*, with some of the most beautifully designed cars at the expo, left me feeling a bit indifferent.

Then, there was the **Tesla Cybertruck**.

I didn’t expect to be as impressed as I was. It has that brutal, no-frills aesthetic that stands out in a crowd—and standing in its presence, I felt ready to click “Order” on the spot if that had been an option. It's rugged, unique, and unmistakably bold. Out of everything at the expo, it was the only car that genuinely made me feel like I was seeing something new.

All in all, it was a fun return to the car expo world, but with a clearer view of what’s hyped and what’s worth it.
